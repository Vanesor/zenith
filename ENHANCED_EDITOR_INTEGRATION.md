# Enhanced Code Editor Integration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the Zenith assignment system to integrate with the Render-deployed compiler service, providing enhanced code execution with detailed performance metrics and analytics.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Removed Unused Files
The assignment folder has been cleaned up by removing unused components:
- `CodeEditor.tsx` (replaced by EnhancedCodeEditor)
- `EnhancedCodeEditor_old.tsx` 
- `ConfirmationModal.tsx` (unused)
- `DraggableQuestionItem.tsx` (unused)
- `QuestionList-enhanced.tsx` (unused)
- `QuestionPreviewModal-fixed.tsx` (unused)
- `AssignmentTaking.tsx` (unused)

### 2. Enhanced API Integration (`/api/code/execute/route.ts`)

#### New Features:
- **Render Service Integration**: Now connects to your deployed compiler service on Render
- **Enhanced Response Handling**: Supports detailed execution metrics including:
  - Individual test case performance
  - Memory usage tracking (KB)
  - CPU usage percentages
  - Execution time per test case
  - Comprehensive execution summaries

#### API Response Structure:
```typescript
interface CompilerResponse {
  success: boolean;
  output: string;
  error: string;
  execution_time: number;
  memory_used?: number;
  testResults?: TestCaseResult[];
  executionSummary?: ExecutionSummary;
  language: string;
  codeLength: number;
}

interface TestCaseResult {
  input: string;
  expectedOutput: string;
  actualOutput: string;
  passed: boolean;
  executionTime: number;
  memoryUsed?: number;
  cpuUsage?: number;
  status: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Code Editor (`EnhancedCodeEditor.tsx`)

#### Fixed Issues:
- **Test Case Display**: Now properly shows enhanced metrics (execution time, memory usage, CPU usage)
- **Custom Input/Output**: Added proper editing experience with clear buttons and better layout
- **Error Handling**: Improved error display with detailed error information
- **Response Processing**: Handles both new enhanced responses and fallback formats

#### New Features:
- **Enhanced Metrics Display**: Shows memory usage, CPU usage, and detailed timing per test case
- **Improved Custom Testing**: Better input/output interface with clear buttons and tips
- **Enhanced Summary Tab**: Displays comprehensive execution analytics including:
  - Total/average execution times
  - Memory usage ranges
  - CPU usage statistics
  - Success rates and status

#### Visual Improvements:
- **Better Status Indicators**: Color-coded test results with enhanced badges
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time display of execution performance data
- **Improved Layout**: Better spacing and organization of metrics and results

## Environment Configuration

Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
# Enhanced Render Compiler Service
COMPILER_SERVICE_URL=https://your-compiler-service.onrender.com
```

Replace `your-compiler-service.onrender.com` with your actual Render deployment URL.

## Compiler Service Features

### Endpoints Used:
- `POST /execute` - Primary endpoint for code execution with test cases
- `POST /compile` - Fallback endpoint for compilation-only operations
- `GET /health` - Service health check

### Enhanced Response Features:
- **Real-time Resource Monitoring**: Memory and CPU usage tracking
- **Detailed Test Case Analysis**: Individual test case performance metrics
- **Comprehensive Execution Summaries**: Overall performance analytics
- **Error Details**: Enhanced error reporting with compilation and runtime details

## Usage Examples

### Test Case Execution with Enhanced Metrics:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/code/execute', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    code: 'def solution(n): return n * 2',
    language: 'python',
    testCases: [
      { input: '5', expectedOutput: '10' },
      { input: '3', expectedOutput: '6' }
    ]
  })
});

// Response includes detailed metrics for each test case
const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.testResults[0].memoryUsed); // Memory usage in KB
console.log(result.testResults[0].cpuUsage);   // CPU usage percentage
console.log(result.executionSummary);         // Overall performance summary
```

### Custom Input Execution:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/code/execute', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    code: 'n = int(input())\nprint(n * 2)',
    language: 'python',
    input: '5'
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.output);        // "10"
console.log(result.executionTime); // Execution time in ms
console.log(result.memoryUsed);    // Memory used in KB
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Compiler Service**: Ensure your compiler service is deployed on Render
2. **Update Environment**: Set `COMPILER_SERVICE_URL` in your environment variables
3. **Test Integration**: Use the enhanced code editor to verify all features work
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check the execution summaries for performance insights

## Benefits

### For Students:
- **Real-time Performance Feedback**: See how efficient their code is
- **Detailed Error Information**: Better debugging with enhanced error details
- **Interactive Testing**: Improved custom input/output testing experience

### For Instructors:
- **Performance Analytics**: Track student code performance and efficiency
- **Detailed Metrics**: Memory usage, CPU usage, and execution time data
- **Enhanced Grading**: More comprehensive data for assessment

### For System:
- **Scalable Architecture**: Offloaded compilation to dedicated Render service
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Detailed performance tracking and analytics
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error reporting and fallback mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Service Timeout**: If the Render service is slow to start (cold start), the first request may timeout
2. **CORS Issues**: Ensure the Render service includes your domain in CORS settings
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify `COMPILER_SERVICE_URL` is correctly set

### Solutions:
1. **Health Check**: Use `/api/code/execute` with a GET request to verify connectivity
2. **Fallback Handling**: The system automatically tries `/compile` endpoint if `/execute` fails
3. **Error Monitoring**: Check browser console and server logs for detailed error information

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Usage**: Track the performance metrics to optimize the system
2. **Scale as Needed**: Monitor Render service performance and scale if necessary
3. **Add Languages**: Extend the compiler service to support additional programming languages
4. **Analytics Integration**: Consider integrating the performance data with analytics systems

The enhanced integration provides a robust, scalable code execution system with comprehensive performance monitoring and analytics, significantly improving the learning experience for students and providing valuable insights for instructors.
