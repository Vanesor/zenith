# 📧 Email Service Setup Guide for Zenith

## Overview
We've implemented a robust email service using **Resend.com** - a modern email API that provides:
- ✅ **3,000 emails/month FREE** (perfect for your needs)
- ✅ Excellent deliverability rates
- ✅ Simple API and great developer experience
- ✅ Professional email templates with college and Zenith branding

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key
1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address
4. Go to **API Keys** section
5. Click **"Create API Key"**
6. Name it "Zenith Production" and copy the key

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Add your Resend API key to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Add this line to your .env.local file
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxx"  # Replace with your actual API key
```

### Step 3: Database Migration
Execute the migration script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the content from supabase-email-logs-migration.sql
-- This adds the necessary columns for enhanced email logging
```

### Step 4: Domain Setup (Optional but Recommended)
For production, set up a custom domain:
1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `mail.yourdomain.com`)
3. Configure DNS records as instructed
4. Update the `from` address in EmailServiceV2.ts

src/lib/
├── EmailServiceV2.ts           # Main email service
├── email-templates/
│   └── base-template.tsx       # Professional email templates
└── TwoFactorAuthService.ts     # Updated for email 2FA

src/app/api/auth/
├── send-verification/route.ts  # Updated to use new service
├── forgot-password/route.ts    # Updated to use new service
└── 2fa/
    ├── email-send/route.ts     # Send 2FA email
    └── email-verify/route.ts   # Verify 2FA email
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Send Verification Email
```typescript
await emailServiceV2.sendVerificationEmail(
  user.email, 
  verificationToken, 
  user.name
);
```

### Send 2FA Code
```typescript
await emailServiceV2.sendOtpEmail(
  user.email, 
  otpCode, 
  '2fa'
);
```

### Send Password Reset
```typescript
await emailServiceV2.sendPasswordResetEmail(
  user.email, 
  resetToken
);
```

## 🏥 Fallback Strategy
The system still maintains Gmail SMTP as a fallback:
- If Resend fails, it can fall back to Gmail
- Existing email logs are preserved
- Gradual migration path

## 📈 Benefits
1. **Better Deliverability** - Resend has excellent reputation
2. **Professional Appearance** - Branded emails build trust
3. **Enhanced Security** - Email 2FA option for users
4. **Better Analytics** - Detailed delivery tracking
5. **Scalability** - Can handle growth up to 3000 emails/month free

## 🔍 Testing
After setup, test the email functionality:
1. Register a new user (verification email)
2. Use forgot password (reset email)  
3. Enable 2FA and test email option (OTP email)
4. Check Supabase email_logs table for delivery status

## 📞 Support
