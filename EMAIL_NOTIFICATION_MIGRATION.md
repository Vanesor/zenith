# Email Notification System Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to migrate from a hybrid notification system (in-app + email) to an email-only notification system in the Zenith platform. All notifications that were previously displayed in-app will now be sent exclusively via email.

## Changes Made

### Database Changes

### Code Changes

1. **NotificationService.ts**:
   - Removed methods for creating in-app notifications
   - Updated notification methods to only send emails
   - Removed redundant notification creation code

2. **EmailService.ts**:
   - Enhanced email tracking functionality
   - Added category and related_id parameters to better organize emails
   - Improved error handling for email sending
   - Updated email templates with direct links to content

## User Impact

- Users will no longer see notifications within the application interface
- All notifications will be delivered to the user's email address
- Email preferences can still be managed in user settings
- Emails will contain direct links to the relevant content

## Email Categories

Emails are now categorized for better tracking and management:

1. **Authentication** - Verification, OTP, password resets
2. **Assignment** - New assignments, updates to existing assignments
3. **Assignment-Result** - Results and feedback for completed assignments
4. **Event** - Event announcements, updates, and reminders
5. **Discussion** - New discussions, replies to discussions

## Migration Steps

1. Run the migration script to update your Supabase database:
   ```
   ./migrate-to-email-notifications.sh
   ```

2. The script will create and apply the necessary migrations to your Supabase project

3. Verify that email service configuration is correct in your `.env` file:
   ```
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SECURE=false
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
   ```

4. Restart the application to apply changes:
   ```
   npm run dev
   # or
   npm run build && npm start
   ```

## Monitoring and Logs

All emails are now logged in the `email_logs` table with the following information:
- Recipient email
- Subject
- Content preview
- Status (sent, failed)
- Category
- Related entity ID (when applicable)
- Timestamp

You can query this table to monitor email delivery and troubleshoot issues.

## Testing

After migration, test the following functionality:

1. Account verification emails
2. Password reset emails
3. Assignment notifications
4. Event notifications
5. Discussion notifications
6. Result notifications

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Restore the database from your Supabase backup
2. Revert code changes from version control
3. Run `supabase db reset` if needed
3. Restart the application
