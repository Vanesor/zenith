# Zenith Enhanced Assignment System

This document provides an overview of the enhanced assignment system implemented for the Zenith platform, with a focus on objective-based assessments, coding challenges, and essay writing.

## 1. Database Schema Updates

The following SQL script has been created to enhance the existing assignments system:
- `/database/enhance_assignments.sql`

This script adds:
- New columns to `assignments` table for assessment configuration
- New tables for questions, options, responses, and security violations
- Support for different question types (single-choice, multiple-choice, coding, essay)
- Proctoring and security features

To apply these changes to your database, run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor.

## 2. Assignment Types and Features

### Assignment Types
- **Objective**: Multiple-choice questions (single and multiple selection)
- **Coding**: Code challenges with language selection (Python, Java, C, JavaScript)
- **Essay**: Text-based responses for writing assignments
- **Regular**: Traditional file upload assignments (existing functionality)

### Key Features
- **Audience Targeting**: Assign to specific club, all clubs, or selected clubs
- **Time Management**: Overall time limits and per-question limits
- **Navigation Control**: Enable/disable moving between questions
- **Proctoring**: Detect tab switching and fullscreen exits

   - View available assignments on the Assignments page
   - Click "Start Assignment" to begin
   - Read instructions and confirm readiness to start
   - For proctored exams, allow fullscreen mode when prompted
   - Answer questions within the time limit
   - Submit the assignment when complete or when time expires

2. **Viewing Results**
   - See immediate results for objective assignments
   - View instructor feedback for subjective assignments after grading

## 6. Security Considerations

The enhanced assignment system implements several security features to maintain academic integrity:

- **Fullscreen Enforcement**: Assignments can require fullscreen mode to prevent accessing other resources
- **Tab Switch Detection**: System detects when students switch to other tabs or applications
- **Warning System**: First violation issues a warning, second violation auto-submits
- **Time Tracking**: Records time spent on each question and overall assignment
- **IP and Browser Logging**: Captures submission metadata for verification

## 7. Implementation Notes

- The system uses client-side monitoring combined with server-side verification
- Questions and answers are securely stored in the database
- Coding questions are designed to be compatible with potential future integration with code execution APIs
- All assignment data is protected by proper authorization checks

## 8. Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:
- Integration with external code execution APIs for real-time code testing
- Support for image and media-based questions
- Peer review capabilities for essay assignments
- AI-assisted grading for essay responses
- Analytics dashboard for instructors to track performance metrics

## 9. Conclusion

The enhanced assignment system provides a comprehensive solution for various assessment needs in the Zenith platform. With support for multiple question types, robust security features, and flexible configuration options, clubs can now create and manage sophisticated assessments directly within the platform.
