## Current Status

According to our migration plan, we have now completed:

- ✅ Phase 2: Core Functionality (100% Complete)
- ✅ Phase 3: Secondary Features (100% Complete)

The migration to PrismaDatabase is now functionally complete for all critical systems.

## Next Steps

While the core migration is complete, here are some recommended follow-up actions:

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Run stress tests on the new Prisma implementation
   - Compare response times with legacy implementation
   - Optimize any slow queries

2. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove legacy Database class references where not needed
   - Clean up any leftover debug code or redundant methods
   - Standardize error handling across all Prisma methods

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update all API documentation to reflect the new implementation
   - Document the new email-only notification system
   - Create examples for developers on how to use the new methods

The migration has successfully improved performance, type safety, and maintainability while adding support for email-only notifications as requested.
