- User profile information at the bottom
- Smooth transitions between states

### 2. College Branding Header

- User profile quick access

### 3. Comprehensive Footer
- Multi-column layout with useful links

## File Structure

The navigation system consists of these new components:

- `src/components/SideNav.tsx` - Side navigation drawer
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Top header with college branding
- `src/components/Footer.tsx` - Site-wide footer

## Usage

1. Run the development server with the new navigation:
```bash
./start-dev-with-nav.sh
```

2. Customize the college logos by replacing:
- `/public/college-logo-1.png`
- `/public/college-logo-2.png`

## Theme Integration

The navigation system integrates with the existing theme system, supporting both light and dark modes.

## Mobile Support

The navigation is fully responsive:
- On desktop, the sidebar can be collapsed to a narrow icon bar
- On mobile, the sidebar transforms into an overlay menu
- The header adapts to smaller screens by hiding less important elements

## Customization

You can customize colors, logos, and menu items by editing the respective component files.
