# Zenith Platform Fixes Summary

## 1. ✅ Java Code Execution Service Enhanced

### Fixed Java compilation and execution in main.py:
- Added proper Java class name extraction and replacement using regex
- Fixed compilation command formatting for Java files
- Enhanced error handling for Java compilation failures
- Added proper timeout handling for Java processes
- Improved memory and CPU monitoring during execution

### Key Changes:
- Added `import re` for regex operations
- Enhanced `create_temp_file()` function for proper Java class handling
- Fixed incomplete sections in `run_command_with_timeout()`
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

## 2. ✅ Event Detail Modal Enhanced

### Made event details popup opaque and theme-based:
- Replaced zenith theme classes with proper dark/light mode support
- Enhanced backdrop blur and opacity
- Improved color contrast for better readability
- Added proper border and background styling

### Changes:
- Background: `bg-black/60 dark:bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-lg`
- Modal: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900` with proper borders
- Header: `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800` 
- Text: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white` for primary text

## 3. ✅ Image Upload on AWS Lightsail Fixed

### Created static file serving infrastructure:
- Added new API route: `/api/static/[...path]/route.ts`
- Updated `LocalStorageService` to use API route in production
- Enhanced file serving with proper MIME types and caching
- Added support for multiple file types (images, PDFs, etc.)

### Key Features:
- Production: Files served via `/api/static/` API route
- Development: Files served via `/uploads/` static route
- Proper caching headers: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- MIME type detection for proper content serving

## 4. ✅ Club Logos Fixed

### Updated club page to use database logo URLs:
- Replaced hardcoded logo paths with `club.logo_url` from database
- Added proper fallback to first letter if logo not available
- Removed complex SVG/PNG fallback logic
- Simplified error handling for missing images

### Before:
```tsx
src={`/uploads/club-logos/${club.name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')}.svg`}
```

### After:
```tsx
{club.logo_url ? (
  <img src={club.logo_url} alt={`${club.name} logo`} />
) : (
  <span>{club.name.charAt(0)}</span>
)}
```

## 5. ✅ Enhanced Theme Support

### Fixed hardcoded colors throughout the application:
- Replaced `bg-gray-*` classes with theme-aware alternatives
- Updated status colors with proper dark mode support
- Enhanced filter dropdowns with consistent theming
- Improved event calendar legend colors

### Examples:
- Past events: `bg-zenith-section text-zenith-muted border-zenith-border`
- Status badges: Added dark mode variants like `dark:bg-green-900/20`
- Borders: `border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`

## 6. ✅ Additional Improvements

### Playground enhancements:
- Added C and C++ language support with proper templates
- Enhanced download functionality for code files
- Improved language configuration structure

### Support page cleanup:
- Removed "Meet the Developer" section
- Updated email to `zenith.forum@stvincentngp.edu.in`
- Removed LinkedIn and Twitter links
- Simplified contact information

## Files Modified:

1. **`src/tmp/main.py`** - Java execution service
2. **`src/app/events/page.tsx`** - Event modal and theme fixes
3. **`src/lib/storage.ts`** - Production file serving
4. **`src/app/api/static/[...path]/route.ts`** - New static file API
5. **`src/app/clubs/page.tsx`** - Club logo fixes
6. **`src/app/playground/page.tsx`** - C/C++ support and download
7. **`src/app/support/page.tsx`** - Contact information updates

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Java Execution**: Test Java code compilation and execution
2. **Image Upload**: Verify images display properly on AWS Lightsail
3. **Club Logos**: Check that club logos load from database URLs
4. **Event Modal**: Verify popup appearance in both light/dark modes
5. **File Downloads**: Test code download functionality in playground
6. **Theme Consistency**: Verify all elements respect light/dark mode settings

## Deployment Notes:

- Ensure `/api/static/` endpoint is accessible in production
- Verify file upload permissions in the uploads directory
- Test image serving performance with caching headers
- Monitor Java execution timeouts and memory usage
- Validate theme switching works across all components
