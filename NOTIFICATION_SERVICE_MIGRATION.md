# NotificationService Migration to Consolidated Database

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Import Statement**
   - Changed from `import Database from "@/lib/database";` to `import { Database, prisma } from "@/lib/database-consolidated";`
   - This change ensures that the NotificationService now uses the consolidated database implementation

2. **Replaced Raw SQL Queries with Prisma Client**
   - Updated club queries to use `prisma.club.findUnique()`
   - Updated assignment queries to use `prisma.assignment.findUnique()`
   - Updated assignment submission queries to use `prisma.assignmentSubmission.findFirst()`
   - Updated event queries to use `prisma.event.findUnique()`
   - Updated user queries to use `prisma.user.findUnique()` and `prisma.user.update()`

3. **Fixed Type Issues**
   - Added proper type casting for notification preferences
   - Added null checks and fallback values for nullable fields

4. **Maintained Raw SQL for Complex Queries**
   - Used `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe()` for complex user queries that would be cumbersome to convert to Prisma query builder
   - This approach maintains compatibility while still using the consolidated database connection

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All database operations now go through a single consolidated database file
2. **Type Safety** - Prisma provides better type checking for database operations
3. **Performance** - Using the optimized Prisma client improves query performance
4. **Maintainability** - Code is now more maintainable with cleaner database access patterns

## Next Steps

- Continue migrating other service files to use the consolidated database
- Consider replacing remaining raw SQL queries with Prisma query builder where appropriate
- Update tests to ensure compatibility with the new database implementation
