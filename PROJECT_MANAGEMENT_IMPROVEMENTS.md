# Project Management Security & UI Improvements

## üîê Enhanced Pass Key Security

### Project Keys (8 characters)
- **Format**: `{ProjectName-2chars}{SecureHash-6chars}`
- **Algorithm**: 
  1. Extract first 2 characters from project name (uppercase, alphanumeric)
  2. Generate 32-byte cryptographically secure nonce
  3. XOR project name chars with multiple nonce layers
  4. HMAC-SHA256 with club-specific salt
  5. Extract 6 secure characters from hash result
  6. Collision detection with up to 50 retry attempts

### Access Passwords (14 characters)
- **Format**: `{ProjectName-2chars}{SecurePassword-12chars}`
- **Advanced Algorithm**:
  1. Generate four separate cryptographically secure nonces (64+64+32+16 bytes)
  2. Extract and prepare project name (5 chars) and creator data (6 chars from name+email)
  3. Multi-stage XOR operations with different nonce combinations
  4. PBKDF2 key derivation with 150,000 iterations using SHA-512
  5. HMAC-SHA512 for final secure hash generation
  6. Uniqueness verification with exponential backoff
  7. Environment-specific secret integration

### Security Features
- **Entropy**: High-entropy random generation using Node.js crypto module
- **Collision Resistance**: Built-in collision detection and retry mechanisms
- **Uniqueness**: Database verification prevents duplicate keys
- **Cryptographic Standards**: Uses industry-standard algorithms (PBKDF2, HMAC-SHA512)
- **Salt Integration**: Club-specific and environment-specific salts

## üé® Modern Kanban-Style UI

### Project Dashboard Redesign
- **Kanban Board**: Four-column layout (To Do, In Progress, Review, Completed)
- **Drag & Drop**: Native HTML5 drag-and-drop for task status updates
- **Visual Cards**: Modern card-based design with priority indicators
- **Task Statistics**: Real-time task counts instead of progress bars
- **Professional Theme**: Consistent with existing Zenith design language

### Key UI Improvements
1. **Task Cards**:
   - Type badges (Task/Bug) with distinct colors
   - Priority indicators with color-coded dots
   - Assignee avatars with initials
   - Due date warnings with overdue alerts
   - Estimated hours display

2. **Interactive Features**:
   - Real-time drag-and-drop status updates
   - Quick task creation from any column
   - Context menus for task actions (Edit/Delete)
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

3. **Statistics Display**:
   - Clean task count badges replacing progress bars
   - Visual indicators for completed vs total tasks
   - Member count and timeline information
   - Project metadata in organized cards

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Permission-Based UI**: Features show/hide based on user permissions
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations and skeleton screens
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and fallbacks
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New Components Created
- `KanbanBoard.tsx`: Main Kanban board with drag-and-drop
- `Avatar.tsx`: User avatar component for assignees
- Enhanced `ProjectCard.tsx`: Improved project cards with task stats

### API Endpoints Enhanced
- `PATCH /api/projects/[id]/tasks/[taskId]`: Update task fields
- `DELETE /api/projects/[id]/tasks/[taskId]`: Delete tasks
- Enhanced task management with comprehensive logging

### Security Methods Added
- `generateProjectKey()`: Advanced 8-character secure key generation
- `generateAccessPassword()`: 14-character cryptographic password generation
- `updateTask()`: Comprehensive task update with activity logging
- `deleteTask()`: Secure task deletion with permission checks

## üöÄ Key Features

### For Project Managers
- Create projects with cryptographically secure access keys
- Invite members using email + secure project password
- Visual task management with Kanban boards
- Real-time progress tracking without progress bars

### For Team Members
- Intuitive drag-and-drop task management
- Clear visual indicators for task priority and status
- Easy task assignment and due date tracking
- Professional dashboard experience similar to Jira

### Security Benefits
- Unguessable project keys using advanced cryptography
- Secure access passwords resistant to brute force attacks
- Protection against timing attacks and rainbow tables
- Database collision prevention with automatic retry logic

## üìä Permissions System
- **Coordinators & Co-coordinators**: Full project creation/management access
- **Zenith Committee**: Complete project oversight capabilities
- **Project Members**: Task creation/editing based on role
- **Granular Controls**: Separate permissions for invite/edit/delete operations

This implementation provides enterprise-level security for project access keys while delivering a modern, intuitive user interface that rivals professional project management tools like Jira.
